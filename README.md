Letta Code is a memory-first coding harness, built on top of the Letta API. Instead of working in independent sessions, you work with a persisted agent that learns over time and is portable across models (Claude Sonnet/Opus, GPT-5, Gemini 3 Pro, GLM-4.6, and more).

**Read more about how to use Letta Code on the [official docs page](https://docs.letta.com/letta-code).**

## Get started
Install the package via [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm):
```bash
npm install -g @letta-ai/letta-code
```
Navigate to your project directory and run `letta` (see various command-line options [on the docs](https://docs.letta.com/letta-code/commands)). 

> [!NOTE]
>  By default, Letta Code will connect to the [Letta Developer Platform](https://app.letta.com/) (includes a free tier), which you can connect to via OAuth or setting a `LETTA_API_KEY`. You can also connect it to a [self-hosted Letta server](https://docs.letta.com/letta-code/configuration#self-hosted-server) by setting `LETTA_BASE_URL`

## Philosophy 
Letta Code is built around long-lived agents that persist across sessions and improve with use. Rather than working in independent sessions, each session is tied to a persisted agent that learns.

**Claude Code / Codex / Gemini CLI** (Session-Based)
- Sessions are independent
- No learning between sessions
- Context = messages in the current session + `AGENTS.md`
- Relationship: Every conversation is like meeting a new contractor

**Letta Code** (Agent-Based)
- Same agent across sessions
- Persistent memory and learning over time
- `/clear` resets the session (clears current in-context messages), but memory persists
- Relationship: Like having a coworker or mentee that learns and remembers

## Agent Memory & Learning
If you’re using Letta Code for the first time, you will likely want to run the `/init` command to initialize the agent’s memory system:
```bash
> /init
```

Over time, the agent will update its memory as it learns. To actively guide your agents memory, you can use the `/remember` command:
```bash
> /remember [optional instructions on what to remember]
```
Letta Code works with skills (reusable modules that teach your agent new capabilities in a `.skills` directory), but additionally supports [skill learning](https://www.letta.com/blog/skill-learning). You can ask your agent to learn a skill from it's current trajectory with the command: 
```bash
> /skill [optional instructions on what skill to learn]
```

Read the docs to learn more about [skills and skill learning](https://docs.letta.com/letta-code/skills).

## Ralph Mode (Iterative Development)

Ralph mode is an iterative development loop where the agent keeps working on a task until it outputs a completion promise or reaches a maximum iteration limit. This is useful for complex tasks that require multiple iterations to complete.

### CLI Usage

Start Ralph mode directly from the command line:

```bash
# Basic Ralph mode
letta --ralph "Add a new feature to my app"

# Ralph mode with custom completion promise
letta --ralph "Fix the bug" --completion-promise "BUG_FIXED"

# Ralph mode with iteration limit
letta --ralph "Refactor code" --max-iterations 5

# Yolo Ralph mode (bypasses permissions)
letta --yolo-ralph "Implement feature X"

# Combined options
letta --ralph "Task description" --completion-promise "DONE" --max-iterations 10
```

### Exit Codes

- `0` - Completion promise matched (task completed successfully)
- `1` - Maximum iterations reached
- `2` - Error occurred

### In-Session Usage

You can also start Ralph mode from within an interactive session:

```bash
> /ralph "Add user authentication"
> /yolo-ralph "Refactor database" --completion-promise "REFACTOR_COMPLETE"
```

Read more about Ralph mode in the [official documentation](https://docs.letta.com/letta-code/ralph-mode).
